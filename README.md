A macro for the Roblox game "Sols RNG"  
Which focuses mainly on paths or collecting items around the map  

### PRE EON 1 SOLS RNG

items spawned around the map and people had to go to them to collect them  
there were a total of 8 item spots  
people didnt like to manually collect these items  
so they would use macros so that they could afk and still collect items  

### POST EON 1 SOLS RNG

They added a new map  
and incresed the item spots to 27  
they also added a new gamepass called "VIP+"  
that costs 350 robux and has an ability to collect items automatically  
which removes the purpose of macros  
and the macro community fell apart  
but there are still more people that doesnt have VIP+ than people who does  
thats why i created this macro which also my first project  

### LOOKING FOR PATH MAKERS

5/27 item spots have paths
